===========

Simple multilayer perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm implementation in Scheme.
Tried to make it verbose and readable.


Caution
-------
Initially committed version appears to work, but does not seem to be correct. Current version does not work as it should, but should be closer to a correct version.

So, work in progress here.


Would be nice to do
-------------------
1. Test everything, find bugs, fix them;
2. Add comments and make it more verbose/readable;
3. Optimize it (especially `propagate-final` function);
4. Add a separate, more sophisticated version, with additional features.
